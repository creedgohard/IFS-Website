            “You have quite honestly been exceptional in dealing with this!
                I have brought far too many cars over the years, maybe 50 or so including Lamborghinis, Ferraris, all sorted of things and without doubt you are the best person I have dealt with in this 15 year period.
                Going forward Catherine I can honestly not see me ever buying another car though anyone else!
                I will be recommending you to all my colleagues here at Lloyds when Bonus time comes round and they all want their new cars.
                I assume IFS is your company is it? If it isn’t please can you forward this to whoever does own it as I would like to emphasize how outstandingly this has been dealt with.“
