            “You have quite honestly been exceptional in dealing with this!
                I have brought far too many cars over the years, maybe 50 or so including Lamborghinis, Ferraris, all sorted of things and without doubt you are the best person I have dealt with in this 15 year period.
                Going forward Catherine I can honestly not see me ever buying another car though anyone else!
                I will be recommending you to all my colleagues here at Lloyds when Bonus time comes round and they all want their new cars.
                I assume IFS is your company is it? If it isn’t please can you forward this to whoever does own it as I would like to emphasize how outstandingly this has been dealt with.“

            “IFS did a lot of research on my behalf; they presented the different finance options available and came up with a deal which was matched to my budget. Would definitely use again and recommend to others. Very efficient and hassle free! “

            “Just to say thanks very much for your assistance in arranging the finance for my Evoque. 
             Historically I have taken the “easy option” and used dealer finance when buying cars but now appreciate the merits of shopping around to find the best deal available. 
             The package you arranged for me is significantly cheaper than that offered by Land Rover. 
             I was delighted with the professional, hassle free service – the little wrinkles which could have caused difficulties were worked round with ease – I would certainly recommend IFS to others and would not hesitate to get quotes for my future car finance arrangements.“
