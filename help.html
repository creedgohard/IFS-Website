    <h1 class="S">Definitions</h1>
    <p class="f2">Buying a car on finance can be very confusing for the first time. With so many different methods and main dealers having their own titles like 'Options' or 'Choices' instead of PCP it really pays to know what all these things mean before you buy.

        Please take a moment to check whether you require outright purchase, monthly set payments or a residual value product where the car can either go back or you own it.
        
        It pays to fully understand these terms before you buy.
        
        Below is a document which will explains different ways  cars can be bought on finance. </p>
